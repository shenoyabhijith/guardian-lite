# Guardian  - Bug Tracking

## Known Issues

### Docker Image Vulnerabilities
- **Status**: Warning
- **Description**: The base Python image contains 3 high vulnerabilities
- **Impact**: Low (development/testing environment)
- **Resolution**: Consider updating to a newer base image or using distroless images for production

## Fixed Issues

### Docker Client Initialization Failures
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Description**: Docker client was failing to initialize, causing NoneType errors throughout the application
- **Root Cause**: Single Docker connection method was failing, no fallback mechanisms
- **Resolution**: 
  - Implemented multiple Docker client initialization methods (unix socket, from_env, TCP)
  - Added comprehensive subprocess fallbacks for all Docker operations
  - Enhanced error handling and logging
- **Impact**: High - All container operations were failing

### NoneType Errors in Backup and Cleanup Functions
- **Status**: Fixed  
- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Description**: Functions were trying to access client.containers and client.images when client was None
- **Root Cause**: Missing null checks before using Docker client
- **Resolution**:
  - Added null checks for all Docker client operations
  - Implemented subprocess fallbacks for backup, rollback, and cleanup operations
  - Enhanced error handling with proper logging
- **Impact**: High - Backup and cleanup operations were completely broken

### Health Check Failures
- **Status**: Fixed
- **Date**: 2025-09-16  
- **Description**: Health checks were failing immediately after container updates
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient time for containers to fully start before health checks
- **Resolution**:
  - Added initial delay before health checks
  - Implemented retry mechanism with multiple attempts
  - Enhanced logging for health check debugging
- **Impact**: Medium - Containers were being rolled back unnecessarily

## Testing Status

✅ **Build Test**: Docker image builds successfully  
✅ **Syntax Test**: Python files compile without errors  
✅ **Runtime Test**: Application starts and serves web interface  
✅ **Integration Test**: GUI loads and responds to requests  
✅ **GitHub Repository**: Successfully created and pushed to GitHub
✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow added for automated testing
✅ **Docker Compose**: Multiple compose files created and tested successfully
✅ **Deployment Scripts**: Both direct Docker and Docker Compose deployment options
✅ **Simplified Scripts**: deploy.sh and destroy.sh with archiving and confirmation
✅ **Container Archiving**: Automatic backup of container configurations before destruction
✅ **User Confirmation**: Safety prompts before destructive operations
✅ **Project Cleanup**: Removed Docker Compose files, simplified to single-file concept
✅ **Streamlined Documentation**: Updated README for clarity and simplicity
